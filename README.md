# Project

So, I have created a mini project and this Mini Project is used for Predicting Customer Churn using Machine Learning.

The mini project involves the following steps:

1.	Downloading a dataset of customer information from a subscription-based service (e.g., telecommunications, streaming service) with a target variable of customer churn.

2.	Preprocessing the dataset by removing irrelevant columns, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables to numerical values.

3.	Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

4.	Training several machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine, to predict customer churn based on the available features.

5.	Evaluating the performance of each model on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6.	Selecting the best-performing model and using it to predict customer churn on a new dataset.

7.	Analyzing the results and discussing the limitations of the approach and possible extensions.
